## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Before this project, I'd never done an image overlay. I'd learned about the position property, but I didn't know it could be used in that way! 

I was also reminded that I need to make sure to include semantic HTML for accessibility. 

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to continue to use semantic HTML and to become more comfortable with Flexbox. This project gave me a lot of confidence. It showed me that I can code something on my own! 

### Useful resources

- [Image Overlay Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exb2ab72Xhs) - This helped me to understand how to put an image overlay on something. I looked at many other resources, but I found that the video was the easiest to understand.
